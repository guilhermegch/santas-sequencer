My project idea is to make a simple ornament. Its implementation is made with a Johnson decade counter IC, the CD4017, to create a sequencer. The clock circuitry was made by transistors, creating an Astable Multivibrator.

To a more complete info about the design, circuit calculations and how it works, check the documentation pdf file.

On images folder, there's the original .svg draws and the .dxf files, accepted by the Kicad software.

This hardware was developed using Kicad 5.1.8 for Linux.
This hardware is free to use, change, and distribute.
